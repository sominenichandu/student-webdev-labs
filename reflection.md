## Reflection Document

### HTML

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises mostly on my own by reading the instructions carefully and using my understanding of HTML. I did not use the solution files or videos, but I searched online occasionally for syntax reminders or examples when needed.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful in making me comfortable with basic HTML structure and tags. The **form exercise (Exercise 04)** was especially useful because it brought together multiple form elements like text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and `fieldset`. It helped me understand how different input types are used in real forms.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I understood most of the concepts well, but I found the part about aligning form labels and inputs a bit tricky. I might have missed it if it was covered in class, but having a bit more guidance or examples in the instructions would have helped me feel more confident about that part.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

The current exercises were really helpful, especially because they were hands-on and built up step by step. A small extra task combining lists, images, and links in one page could have helped tie everything together better. But overall, the exercises covered the topics well.

### Accessibility

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

Yes, I am completed this exercise on my own.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

This exercise was really helpful in showing how small changes like adding labels and landmarks can improve accessibility.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I wish the importance of using `for` and `id` together in labels was explained a bit more clearly upfront.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think a small challenge with a messy page full of different accessibility issues would’ve made things more fun and helped me learn even better.

### CSS

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I put in a lot of time and effort to do the tasks myself, and the lab videos were super helpful. I did look through the videos and solution files whenever i got stuck, especially doing the media queries part.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises are very helpful in understading the ow CSS works in real layouts. The exercise 6 with media queries as of the greatest help to me because it made every thing clear.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Yes, I wish the specificity topic had a bit more explanation with simpler examples. It took me some time to understand how to calculate it. A quick breakdown of the point system would’ve really helped.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Yes, most of the topics you’re covering in class are really helping me understand how CSS works. The hands-on exercises make it easier to connect the concepts with real code, and each task builds on the one before it, which makes learning easier.

### Flexbox

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I spent a good amount of time trying the exercises on my own, and the videos helped a lot. I checked the solution files and videos whenever I got stuck, especially with wrapping and alignment.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful for understanding how Flexbox works. The one with column wrapping and reverse order helped me the most, especially for mobile layouts.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I wish the media queries and flex item reordering were explained in more detail. It took me some time to understand how to make layouts adjust on smaller screens.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think more practice with responsive layouts and flex combinations would’ve helped. Maybe an exercise focused only on mobile view changes would make it easier to learn.

### CSS - GRID

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I worked through most of the exercises on my own, but referred videos when I got stuck. They were especially helpful when figuring out how to structure the grids and handle the responsive layout.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful in understanding how CSS Grid works in real layouts. The second exercise stood out the most for me because it showed how to use grid areas in a responsive design, which made things click better.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I think it would’ve helped if there was a bit more explanation on how grid areas adjust at different screen sizes. I got it eventually, but at first it was a little confusing how the layout shifts with media queries.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think a couple more exercises using grid-template-areas on different screen sizes would've helped. It would’ve been nice to get a bit more practice with trickier layouts to really feel more confident using it.

### BOOTSTARP

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I tried on my own first. When I ran into issues, especially with grid layout behavior and modals, I referred to the videos for clarification. The solution files were helpful when I needed to double check my structure.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

I found the exercises really useful for getting comfortable with Bootstrap. The grid one was especially helpful it made it easier to understand how everything resizes on different screens. Seeing it actually work helped the concept make a lot more sense.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Yeah, I think the modal part could’ve used a bit more explanation. It worked fine once I followed the steps, but understanding how all the pieces fit together like the data attributes and structure was a little confusing at first.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think adding a small project that combines cards, grid, and modals together would’ve been helpful. It would’ve given more practice using everything in one layout, which could make it easier to remember how each part works.

### JAVASCRIPT

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I tried to work through the exercises on my own first, and only turned to the videos or solution files when I got stuck. They were really helpful for understanding things I couldn’t figure out right away, especially with parts involving events.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful for understanding how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how to use functions like map, filter, and reduce. The fetch exercise stood out the most it helped me connect working with APIs and updating the page dynamically, which felt very real-world.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

Yeah, the destructuring part was a bit tricky at first. I kinda struggled with pulling values from deep inside the object. It took me a few tries to understand how to pull everything out cleanly.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

Maybe an extra exercise focused just on combining fetch with DOM updates would’ve helped. It took a bit to fully connect how data from an API can be displayed and styled on the page dynamically.

### JQUERY

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I tried to complete the exercises on my own first, especially the jQuery parts. I did refer to the solution videos when I got stuck, mostly to understand how `.ajax()` works and how to handle DOM updates properly. The examples really helped clarify things when my code wasn’t working as expected.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful in understanding how jQuery works compared to plain JavaScript. The AJAX exercise was especially useful because it tied everything together.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I think the difference between using `fetch()` and `$.ajax()` could’ve been explained a bit more, especially when to use one over the other.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

A small exercise on using jQuery to dynamically add or remove elements based on user interaction would've been helpful. Maybe something like a to-do list could’ve given more hands on practice with real time DOM updates and jQuery chaining.
