## Reflection Document

### HTML

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

I was able to complete the exercises mostly on my own by reading the instructions carefully and using my understanding of HTML. I did not use the solution files or videos, but I searched online occasionally for syntax reminders or examples when needed.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

The exercises were really helpful in making me comfortable with basic HTML structure and tags. The **form exercise (Exercise 04)** was especially useful because it brought together multiple form elements like text inputs, radio buttons, checkboxes, and `fieldset`. It helped me understand how different input types are used in real forms.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I understood most of the concepts well, but I found the part about aligning form labels and inputs a bit tricky. I might have missed it if it was covered in class, but having a bit more guidance or examples in the instructions would have helped me feel more confident about that part.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

The current exercises were really helpful, especially because they were hands-on and built up step by step. A small extra task combining lists, images, and links in one page could have helped tie everything together better. But overall, the exercises covered the topics well.

### Accessibility

### 1. Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the videos or the solutions for help?

Yes, I am completed this exercise on my own.

### 2. How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one exercise that was particularly helpful?

This exercise was really helpful in showing how small changes like adding labels and landmarks can improve accessibility.

### 3. Was there something that you wish had been explained better?

I wish the importance of using `for` and `id` together in labels was explained a bit more clearly upfront.

### 4. Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this week’s topic a little better?

I think a small challenge with a messy page full of different accessibility issues would’ve made things more fun and helped me learn even better.
